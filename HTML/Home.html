        <p class="aboutText">
          I’ve always been fascinated by how things move, think, and work
          together, which is why I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Mechanical
          Engineering (Honours) with Mathematical and Computer Sciences, aiming
          to major in Mechatronics and Robotics. The challenge of turning
          complex ideas into real-world solutions excites me, and I thrive in
          hands-on projects where innovation meets practicality.
          <br /><br />
          I have hands-on experience in robotics, CAD, and system integration,
          gained through various projects and team collaborations. Being part of
          innovative engineering initiatives, including the Adelaide Rover Team,
          has allowed me to develop both my technical and teamwork skills, while
          strengthening my curiosity and drive to keep learning.
          <br /><br />
          Beyond robotics, I’m driven by a curiosity for the unknown, a love for
          problem-solving, and a desire to contribute to cutting-edge
          engineering projects. I enjoy mentoring, sharing knowledge with peers,
          and constantly learning new skills to stay at the forefront of
          mechatronics and intelligent systems. My goal is to combine mechanical
          design, programming, and innovation to tackle real-world challenges
          and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
